# password-generator
Creating a password generator webpage using CSS, HTML, &amp; Java

## Description 

In this project, I worked with javascript to create a randomized password to display to the user. In order to do this, I first created prompts and confirm statements to allow the user to specify password criteria. Once those answers were received, I utilized a combination of conditional statements in order to determine which characters to include in the password (special characters, numerical values, etc.) and created corresponding variables to pull from. Finally, I created a for loop in order to randomly generate the password. 

This project allowed me to work with a variety of javascript elements and ultimately resulted in a webpage that was able to callibrate based on user input.
